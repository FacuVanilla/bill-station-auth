# 🚂 Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue: Healthcheck Failed**

Your Railway deployment is failing because:
1. **Healthcheck timeout** - The application isn't responding quickly enough
2. **Service unavailable** - The Django app isn't starting properly
3. **PORT variable issues** - Environment variable handling problems

## 🔧 **Immediate Fixes**

### **Fix 1: Use Simplified Configuration (Recommended)**

Replace your current `railway.json` with the simplified version:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python manage.py migrate --noinput && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput && gunicorn auth_service.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 5
  }
}
```

### **Fix 2: Use Minimal Requirements**

Railway will use `requirements_railway.txt` instead of `requirements.txt` to avoid dependency conflicts.

### **Fix 3: Health Check Endpoint**

I've added a simple `/health/` endpoint that Railway can use to verify your app is running.

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Fix Process**

### **Step 1: Update Your Repository**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment issues with simplified configuration"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: In Railway Dashboard**
1. **Go to your service settings**
2. **Click "Variables" tab**
3. **Add these environment variables:**
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=False
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app.railway.app
   PORT=8000
   ```

### **Step 3: Redeploy**
1. **Railway will automatically redeploy**
2. **Monitor the deployment logs**
3. **Check for any new error messages**

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: "Module not found"**
**Solution:** Railway will use `requirements_railway.txt` which has minimal, compatible dependencies.

### **Issue: "Database connection failed"**
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure PostgreSQL service is added to your Railway project
2. Check that `DATABASE_URL` is automatically set
3. The startup command includes `python manage.py migrate`

### **Issue: "Redis connection failed"**
**Solution:**
1. Ensure Redis service is added to your Railway project
2. Check that `REDIS_URL` is automatically set
3. The app will fall back to local memory cache if Redis fails

### **Issue: "Permission denied"**
**Solution:** The simplified startup command doesn't use shell scripts, avoiding permission issues.

## 🔍 **Monitoring Your Deployment**

### **Check Railway Logs**
1. **Go to your service in Railway dashboard**
2. **Click "Deployments" tab**
3. **Click on the latest deployment**
4. **Look for these success messages:**
   ```
   🚀 Starting Django application on Railway...
   📍 Using port: 8000
   🗄️  Running database migrations...
   📁 Collecting static files...
   🚀 Starting Gunicorn server on port 8000...
   ```

### **Test Health Check**
Once deployed, test:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/health/
```
Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Django Auth Service is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-29T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## 🎯 **Why This Fix Works**

### **Simplified Startup Command**
- No complex shell scripts
- Direct Python commands
- Proper error handling
- Railway-friendly syntax

### **Minimal Requirements**
- Only essential dependencies
- Compatible versions
- No conflicting packages
- Faster build times

### **Health Check Endpoint**
- Simple JSON response
- No authentication required
- Fast response time
- Railway can verify app is running

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After applying these fixes:
1. ✅ **Build succeeds** - No dependency conflicts
2. ✅ **Startup succeeds** - Django starts properly
3. ✅ **Health check passes** - Railway can verify the app
4. ✅ **App becomes available** - Your API is accessible

## 🔄 **If Issues Persist**

### **Alternative: Use Procfile**
Railway can also use the `Procfile`:
```
web: python manage.py migrate --noinput && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput && gunicorn auth_service.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120
```

### **Alternative: Manual Deployment**
1. **Delete the current Railway service**
2. **Create a new one from scratch**
3. **Use the simplified configuration**
4. **Add services one by one**

## 📱 **Testing Your Fixed Deployment**

### **Health Check**
- Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/health/`
- Should show healthy status

### **API Documentation**
- Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- Should show Swagger UI

### **API Endpoints**
- Test registration: `POST /api/v1/users/register/`
- Test login: `POST /api/v1/users/login/`
